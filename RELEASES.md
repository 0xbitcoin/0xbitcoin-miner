* Update 1.5.23 - Legacy CPU Miner
This new build uses the C++ addon to accelerate the CPU mining one-thousand fold.  Pool mine with the command 'pool mine'.  Select a different pool with 'pool select http://...'.  Keep in mind that this update will migrate all vault data to a new and improved version so be sure to back up your private keys.  1.5.20 fixes bugs with solo mining and adds 'test mine' command.
